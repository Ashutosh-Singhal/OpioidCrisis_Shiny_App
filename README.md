# OpioidCrisis_Shiny_App

Background:

- In the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to opioid pain relievers and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates. 
- Increased prescription of opioid medications led to widespread misuse of both prescription and non-prescription opioids before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.

Aim of this project: 
- This project sought to visualize the problem as it relates to opioid prescriptions. We looked into the prescribing habits of a sample of 25,000 American doctors in 2014. We searched for insights and answers to how prescription opioids are linked to opioid deaths.

Future goals:
- Accidental death by fatal drug overdose is a rising trend in the United States. In 2017 HHS declared a public health emergency. 
- With new datasets avaiable, we can learn something from history and make models to combat opioid epidemic, which has swept across the United States.

Data:
This dataset contains summaries of prescription records for 250 common opioid and non-opioid drugs written by 25,000 unique licensed medical professionals in 2014 in the United States for citizens covered under Class D Medicare as well as some metadata about the doctors themselves. This is a small subset of data that was sourced from cms.gov. The full dataset contains almost 24 million prescription instances in long format.
